This is an android application that displays a list of movies. 
At the top of the screen, there is a switch that can be used to toggle the sorting arrangment of the list.

## Architecture

While developing this application, I used the **Google recommended** [android app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture#recommended-app-arch) 
as a guideline to organize the code base into three distint layers: UI layer, Domain layer and Data layer.

The UI layer of the app is written completely in Jetpack Compose. There are no Fragments, only Composable screens.

## Module Structure

I also followed the **Google recommended** [modularization structure](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization/patterns#types-of-modules),
and I grouped the code base into three main modules: 
1) ```app```: This is the container module of the application. Its sole duty is to display all features of the application
2) ```core```: The core module serves as the base module. It contains code that can be resued across any part of the code base.
3) ```feature```: The feature module contains all features of the application.

## Test

The code base contains unit tests and UI test for the Composable screens. These can be found here:

UI tests: https://github.com/Jeff-Emuveyan/distilled/blob/master/feature/movies/src/androidTest/java/com/example/movies/MoviesScreenTest.kt

Domain layer unit tests: https://github.com/Jeff-Emuveyan/distilled/blob/master/core/domain/src/test/java/com/example/domain/FormatMovieListResponseUseCaseTest.kt

Repository unit tests: https://github.com/Jeff-Emuveyan/distilled/blob/master/core/data/src/test/java/com/example/data/repository/MovieRepositoryTest.kt

## Something extra! üòÅ

It is very important to monitor the performance of an android app so that issues such as slow startup time and UI jank can be spotted early and resolved.

Because of this, I wrote a [macrobenchmark](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/benchmarking/macrobenchmark-overview) test to monitor the startup time
of the app.

This test can be found here:
